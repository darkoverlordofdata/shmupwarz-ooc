# Liquid.Coffee

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/darkoverlordofdata/liquid.coffee.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/darkoverlordofdata/liquid.coffee)

Liquid Coffee Template Engine

Liquid.coffee was ported from a fork of (liquid 2.2.2) [https://github.com/Shopify/liquid-old], after which the following additions were made:

- Liquid Inheritance tags

    + block
    + extend

- Liquid3 tags

    + break
    + continue
    + decrement
    + increment

This library was created as a plugin for huginn and named huginn-liquid.
Version 0.0.9 is the last available version on npmjs.org under that name.
Going forward, this will be liquid.coffee, starting with version 0.1.0

My site, http://darkoverlordofdata.com is generated with huginn using liquid.coffee.
For bower users, there is also a browserified distribution in the dist folder.
